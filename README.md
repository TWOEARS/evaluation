Evaluation of single Two!Ears Auditory Model components
=======================================================

This repository should provide scripts for evaluation and performance testing of single Two!Ears model components like the localisation or identification knowledge sources. For each component a single folder should be created, containing a README with the description of the actual performance testing and an introduction how to run the performance testing yourself.
